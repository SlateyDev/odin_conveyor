# Conveyor: ODIN + RayLib test project

This project is a personal challenge to make something in ODIN. The
challenge needed a further goal and that was something to make so I
decided to make a conveyor system. To help with the creation of this
conveyor system I decided to work with RayLib.

Any other features are just because I wanted to learn to use them at
the same time while I was learning ODIN and decided to use this
project as part of that learning. eg. MicroUI, memory tracking
allocator, vscode launch/tasks configuration.

This project has been setup to hopefully "just work" when loaded
into a vscode environment on a system that has odin installed. The
configuration for the launch/tasks vscode configuration files were
found in another repository and modified slightly to my own personal
tastes.
